									<p>born in 1990 in Santiago, Chile. I firmly believe that web design has the potential to be more diverse and, above all, inspiring. My approach is based on the belief that every website can be a masterpiece of creativity and functionality. Through my experience and passion, I seek to elevate web design to a higher level, constantly exploring new ideas and approaches.
									</p>
									<p>
										My vision as a web designer is to inspire and elevate the perception of online design. I dream of an internet where each website is a unique and captivating experience. I want to demonstrate that web design is not limited to pre-established conventions, but can be a means for innovation, expression, and meaningful connection. My goal is to motivate others to think outside the box and explore new possibilities in web design.
									</p>
									<p>	
										My mission is to introduce the world to the infinite possibilities of web design. To achieve this, I am committed to continuing to experiment and challenge established norms in digital design. I constantly seek new forms of expression and functionality, embracing creativity in every project I undertake. Through my work, I hope to inspire other designers and clients to embrace diversity and innovation in web design.</p>
